Color Schemes
=============

The Mastoron color schemes offer a quick and easy way to display the information that you have on your objects.
Simply select all the objects and apply a color scheme for a parameter of your choice. Mastoron will apply a set of default colors to your objects.

Some of the most notable features are:

    *Use the *Edit Color Scheme* button to change the colors in a scheme.
    *Use the *Export* or *Import* buttons to share a color scheme from one model to another.
    *Use the *Clear Colors* button to clear the color overrides for a specific color scheme in the current, or all views.
