Get Started
===========

To use Mastoron in a Revit project, use the **Settings** button to connect the current project to a mastoronConfig.json file.
This is the place where mastoron stores all information on:

    * Colors schemes

        1. Parameter name
        2. Colors for the values

    * Element overrides

        1. Views
        2. Elements and their colorscheme per view

To import a color scheme from another project, either copy paste from one JSON to another or use the export/import buttons to write a single colors scheme to a JSON file.

Color Schemes
-------------

The Mastoron :ref:`color-schemes` offer a quick and easy way to display the information that you have on your objects.
Simply select all the objects and apply a color scheme for a parameter of your choice. Mastoron will apply a set of default colors to your objects.

Some of the most notable features are:

    * Use the *Edit Color Scheme* button to change the colors in a scheme.
    * Use the *Export* or *Import* buttons to share a color scheme from one model to another.
    * Use the *Clear Colors* button to clear the color overrides for a specific color scheme in the current, or all views.
