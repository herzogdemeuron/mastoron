Get Started
===========

To use Mastoron in a Revit project, use the **Settings** button to connect the current project to a mastoronConfig.json file. When setting up a new project this is gonna be just an empty JSON file.
This is the place where mastoron stores all information on:

    * Colors schemes

        1. Parameter name
        2. Colors for the values

    * Element overrides

        1. Views
        2. Elements and their colorscheme per view

To import a color scheme from another project, either copy paste from one JSON to another or use the export/import buttons to write a single colors scheme to a JSON file.

Color Schemes
-------------

The Mastoron color schemes offer a quick and easy way to display the information that you have on your objects.
Simply select all the objects and apply a color scheme for a parameter of your choice. Mastoron will apply a set of default colors to your objects.

Some of the most notable features are:

    * Use the *Edit Color Scheme* button to change the colors in a scheme.
    * Use the *Export* or *Import* buttons to share a color scheme from one model to another.
    * Use the *Clear Colors* button to clear the color overrides for a specific color scheme in the current, or all views.

Create
------

Mastoron offers quick and easy ways to create walls, floors and roofs from massing objects. In contrast to the standard revit massing features the mastoron methods work with multiple base objects at the same time and host the resulting objects on the correct levels -> More Better!
Any kind of object that contains geometry can be used as a starting point.

Mastoron helps you deduct from massing geometry:

    * Walls
    * Floors
    * Roofs
