Get Started
===========

To use Mastoron in a Revit project, use the *Settings* button to connect the current project to a mastoronConfig.json file.
This is the place where mastoron stores all information:

    *Colors schemes
        *Parameter name
        *Colors for the values
    *Element overrides
        *Views
        *Elements
        *Colors

To import a color scheme from another project, either copy paste from one JSON to another or use the export/import buttons to write a single colors scheme to a JSON file.
