Data
=========

Mastoron offers a unified way to schedule areas and levels in Revit. It allows you to keep your modelling flexible and your data complete.


Calculate Areas
---------------

Takes all the bottom faces of selected object and write the sum of their areas into the **Mass Area** parameter.

Calculate Levels
----------------

Takes the lowest surface of selected objects and searches to document for the closest level. Writes the resulting level name into the **Mass Level** parameter.
