The color-value pairs are stored as a mastoron colors scheme and can be adjusted using the [Edit Color Scheme](EditColorScheme.pushbutton/README.md) button.

Every new value added to a color scheme will get a new default color assigned.
The color overrides can be reset using the [Clear Colors](Visualize.panel/ColorScheme.pulldown/ClearColors.pushbutton/README.md) button
